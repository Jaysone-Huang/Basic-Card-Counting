# Basic-Card-Counting
A simple manual input card counting software for card gambling.
The cards 2-6 will add +1 where cards 7-9 will add +0 and cards 10-King will add -1.
This calculation will help with a general representation of how good the deck currently is. Will assume there are 8 decks of cards as most casinos uses 8 decks for blackjack. As you enter in cards, the software will subtract the card from the deck and give a rough estimate of the possibility of each card.
